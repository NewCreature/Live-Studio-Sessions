Live Studio Sessions Issues
---------------------------

[X]Fix song loading issues for GH, RB, etc. GH shows no notes, BH crashes, etc.

[X]Add profile system.

[X]Store relevant info in the song list (artist, title, etc.).

[X]Silence audio for current part if note is missed and there is an audio track
   assigned.

[ ]Make song selection screen more intelligent by only allowing valid
   selections.

[ ]Make controls configurable.

[ ]Add a way to adjust AV Delay.

[ ]Add touch screen controls.

[ ]Fix beat lines.

[ ]Add online leaderboard support.

[ ]Implement "perfect" bonus for hitting the notes sufficiently accurately.

   [ ]This should play into the awards system. We might require getting all 
      perfect hits to qualify for a multiplatinum award.

[ ]Store scores in profile config. Should probably just store each song's score
   info under a header using its unique ID. The scores should be stored using
   the same obfuscation technique used by the leaderboard code.

[ ]Add song results screen.

[ ]Adjust balance of failing mechanism. It is way too hard at the moment.
