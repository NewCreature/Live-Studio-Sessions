Live Studio Sessions Issues
---------------------------

[X]Fix song loading issues for GH, RB, etc. GH shows no notes, BH crashes, etc.

[X]Add profile system.

[X]Store relevant info in the song list (artist, title, etc.).

[X]Silence audio for current part if note is missed and there is an audio track
   assigned.

[X]Make song selection screen more intelligent by only allowing valid
   selections.

[X]Store scores in profile config. Should probably just store each song's score
   info under a header using its unique ID. The scores should be stored using
   the same obfuscation technique used by the leaderboard code.

[ ]Make controls configurable.

[ ]Add a way to adjust AV Delay.

[ ]Add touch screen controls.

[ ]Fix beat lines.

   [ ]When two beat markers are sufficiently close, they should be merged.
   
   [ ]Make beat line generation code more robust so it can handle "non-standard"
      positioning of tempo changes.

[ ]Add online leaderboard support.

[ ]Implement "perfect" bonus for hitting the notes sufficiently accurately.

   [ ]This should play into the awards system. We might require getting all 
      perfect hits to qualify for a multiplatinum award.

[ ]Add song results screen.

[ ]Adjust balance of failing mechanism. It is way too hard at the moment.

[ ]Find what is causing the game to freeze sometimes when stopping the song
   audio.

[ ]Figure out a way to make sure the audio and video timing is consistent. I
   think it can be fixed by using a mixer callback to let us know when some
   some samples are being sent to the sound driver. If we start the streams at
   that moment, we should have enough time to start the streams before the next
   buffer fill is required and get more conistent timing as a result.
