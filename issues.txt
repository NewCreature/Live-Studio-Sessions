Live Studio Sessions Issues
---------------------------

[X]Fix song loading issues for GH, RB, etc. GH shows no notes, BH crashes, etc.

[X]Add profile system.

[X]Store relevant info in the song list (artist, title, etc.).

[X]Silence audio for current part if note is missed and there is an audio track
   assigned.

[X]Make song selection screen more intelligent by only allowing valid
   selections.

[X]Store scores in profile config. Should probably just store each song's score
   info under a header using its unique ID. The scores should be stored using
   the same obfuscation technique used by the leaderboard code.

[X]Make controls configurable.

[X]Add a way to adjust AV Delay.

[X]Improve note hit detection.

   [X]Hit closest matching note among hittable notes.

   [X]Allow HOPO notes to be played more sloppily by allowing lower fret buttons to
      be ignored.

[X]Figure out why last note cannot be played.

[X]Add support for forced HOPO.

[X]Add touch screen controls.

   [X]Add on-screen display of controller layout.
   
   [X]Allow song list to be navigated with touch.

[X]Add song results screen.

[X]Add online leaderboard support.

[X]Figure out why results screen is giving 0 platinums even when completing
   song.

[X]Prevent song list from scrolling past the end of the list.

[X]Make icon.

[X]Implement "perfect" bonus for hitting the notes sufficiently accurately.

   [X]This should play into the awards system. We might require getting all 
      perfect hits to qualify for a multiplatinum award.

[X]Select song folder from options screen or the first time the song list is
   displayed.

[X]Figure out why some HOPO notes aren't marked correctly. So far it looks like
   it might be something to do with being the second note.

[X]Add some sample songs to the game for people without song libraries to play
   with.

[X]Don't kill streak when strumming a HOPO note. Player should have the option
   to strum if they want.

[X]Stummed HOPO notes should count the accuracy of the stum and not the HOPO.
   This will ensure scoring matches player intent.

[X]Ensure strum actions are used up. Currently, it is possible to strum and then
   press the appropriate notes and have it count as a hit. Need to check the
   pressed member to determine if it is being properly reset.

[X]Make sure root changelog gets packaged in the source package.

[X]Fix HOPO being hittable even when previous note was not hit.

[ ]Figure out why there aren't enough beat markers being generated on some
   songs.

[ ]Investigate crash issues.

   [X]Crashes on game init.
   
   [ ]Crashes on song audio start.

[ ]Use smart logic to determine how many beats to add before the song audio. We
   should ensure there are at least two measures before the first playable note
   and we should only add enough beats to make two measure before time to play.
   
   We can probably assume the first beat starts a measure and we should count
   beats in groups of 4. If a note occurs within a measure, we can take note of
   which measure it is in. If the note occurs before the third measure, we
   should add the necessary measures worth of beats to get the pre-play measures
   up to 2.
   
   This will ensure that songs with extra delay added will not have excessive
   delay, while songs that use the original CD audio can work well with the game
   as well.

[ ]Get Android port up and running.

   [ ]Fix RTK IO module to allow using non-standard backends. We need it to be
      able to open and read files through Allegro's IO routines in order to get
      this port running.

   [ ]Figure out why AV Setup isn't working.
   
   [ ]Figure out why game crashes when trying to start a song.
   
[ ]Adjust board scroll speed and note positioning according to BPM.

   All the game's logic will operate in ticks. Only the rendering will be
   affected by these proposed changes.

   [ ]Store note z-coordinates at init and use those during rendering.
   
   [ ]Add camera so we can traverse the board.
   
   [ ]Change camera speed when crossing a tempo event.
   
      [ ]Store tempo events in LSS_SONG. We want to keep real-time calculations
         to a minimum so we should store a copy of each tempo event with time
         converted to in-game ticks.

[X]Fix beat lines.

   [X]When two beat markers are sufficiently close, they should be merged.
   
   [X]Figure out why beat line accuracy is off for songs with no tempo changes.
   
   [ ]Make beat line generation code more robust so it can handle "non-standard"
      positioning of tempo changes.

[ ]Adjust balance of failing mechanism. It is way too hard at the moment.

[ ]Find what is causing the game to freeze sometimes when stopping the song
   audio.

[ ]Figure out a way to make sure the audio and video timing is consistent. I
   think it can be fixed by using a mixer callback to let us know when some
   some samples are being sent to the sound driver. If we start the streams at
   that moment, we should have enough time to start the streams before the next
   buffer fill is required and get more conistent timing as a result.
