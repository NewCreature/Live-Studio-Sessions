Live Studio Sessions Issues
---------------------------

[X]Set default instrument volume for tracks being played by players to 100.

[X]Set instrument volume for non-played tracks to 75% so the instruments players
   are playing are more prominent.

[X]Add a way to select a random song.

[ ]Add particle effects.

[ ]Implement careers.

   [ ]Careers should be customizable. You should be able to create a new career
      based on a song collection, or by adding songs yourself. To start, we'll
      just allow creating from a song collection. We need the underlying code to
      be structured in such a way that a career is not tied to a specific song
      collection so we can support custom careers.

   [ ]We'll need to implement a career view in the song list screen. The song
      list screen should support dividers and spacers so we can make the list
      look nice and be intuitive to use.

[ ]Look into partial note hit acceptance. Some note combinations aren't playable
   on keyboards due to hardware limitations.

[ ]See if we can make note tails for missed notes look better. We might render
   them below the fret button graphics and/or erase them as they cross over the
   fret button line.

[ ]Look into keeping the logic and audio synced in case of audio stutter. We
   should be able to detect when the audio has fallen behind and seek ahead when
   that occurs.

[ ]Look into adjusting board speed on the fly based on the current BPM. This
   would make songs with major BPM changes work better but might not look good.

[ ]Clean up track select by only showing valid tracks. Check for standard track
   names and show a cleaner version of the name if we know what it is.

[ ]Add multiplayer.

   [ ]We'll need to rearrange the menus for this to work. Players will need to
      be able to join and leave the game at will from the menus.

   [ ]We'll need to allow configuring multiple controllers. Each controller will
      need to have its own buttons accept and back actions. We might use the
      color codes to represent these actions. Pressing the accept button should
      immediately add a new player to the game.

   [ ]The song list screen will need to be able to handle multiple players
      making selections. Players will be able to select their desired track and
      difficulty for the currently selected song.

[ ]Look into ranking issues.

[ ]Look into measure markers. Not sure if this is feasible.

[ ]Traverse MIDI ticks to generate beat markers instead of restarting each time
   we hit a BPM change. BPM changes are not guaranteed to occur on beat markers.
