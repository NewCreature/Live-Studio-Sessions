Live Studio Sessions Issues
---------------------------

[ ]Set default instrument volume for tracks being played by players to 100.

[ ]Set instrument volume for non-played tracks to 75% so the instruments players
   are playing are more prominent.

[ ]See if we can make note tails for missed notes look better. We might render
   them below the fret button graphics and/or erase them as they cross over the
   fret button line.

[ ]Look into keeping the logic and audio synced in case of audio stutter. We
   should be able to detect when the audio has fallen behind and seek ahead when
   that occurs.

[ ]Look into adjusting board speed on the fly based on the current BPM. This
   would make songs with major BPM changes work better but might not look good.

[ ]Clean up track select by only showing valid tracks. Check for standard track
   names and show a cleaner version of the name if we know what it is.

[ ]Add multiplayer.

[ ]Look into partial note hit acceptance. Some note combinations aren't playable
   on keyboards due to hardware limitations.

[ ]Look into ranking issues.

[ ]Look into measure markers. Not sure if this is feasible.

[ ]Traverse MIDI ticks to generate beat markers instead of restarting each time
   we hit a BPM change. BPM changes are not guaranteed to occur on beat markers.

[ ]Monitor audio playback position to ensure it doesn't desync.
