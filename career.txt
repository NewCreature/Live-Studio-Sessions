Live Studio Sessions Career Mode Design Document
------------------------------------------------

A player's career begins with a humble demo tape. The player will record five
songs onto a demo tape that will be sent to the record company.

 * The player must select five unique songs from their song library to record.
 * The songs are recorded in live studio sessions, where the player will play
   the songs Guitar Hero style. Play accuracy affects the amount of money
   offered by the record company to produce the first album.

Once the player is an established recording artist, they are free to produce
new records using songs from their song library.

 * The goal is to accumulate a certain amount of money so that you can start
   your own record company.
 * Players choose ten songs from their song library to record for each album.
 * Studio time costs money. You must spend your money wisely to make a profit on
   your albums so you can accumulate enough to reach your eventual goal.
 * Each album must be made of ten unique songs from the player's song library.
 * Money is earned from records sold from finished albums. The amount is
   determined by the total number of points and the accuracy of playback. Higher
   difficulty means more money could be earned, but could also mean bankruptcy
   if you are unable to produce your album before running out of money. The
   player must have a certain amount of accuracy for a recording to be able to
   be included on an album.
