Live Studio Sessions
--------------------

Description
-----------

A rhythm game based on Frets On Fire where your goal is to make records. Get
high scores by playing songs as accurately as possible.


Installation
------------

How to install.


Getting Started
---------------

Use the mouse or keyboard to navigate the menus. You can also control the menus
using a configured guitar controller (select Options on the main menu, then
Controls).


Playing the Game
----------------

You play the game by holding the fret buttons that match the incoming note
markers, and strumming when the notes cross the strum line.

To play with a keyboard, it is recommended that you hold the keyboard in your
left hand with your fingers positioned over the F1-F5 keys. This makes the game
play feel similar to playing with a guitar controller.
