Description:

Live Studio Sessions is a rhythm game inspired by Frets On Fire and FoFiX.

Building the Game:

The game is built using GCC and depends on Allegro 5.2.x and libcurl. Builds for Mac OS X, Windows, Ubuntu and Android are available on the project's homepage: http://www.t3-i.com/pages/project.php?id=live_studio_sessions

To build the game yourself, simply change to the 'src' directory, type 'make', and press Enter. Assuming you have installed all of the dependencies, the game should build and you should have an executable in the 'bin' directory.
